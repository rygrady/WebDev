			<h2>Why I Went To Niagra Falls</h2>
			<p>I went to Niagra Falls during the summer before 7<sup>th</sup> grade. I went with my Dad who surprised me a week before going to the Falls. My Dad decided on <br> Niagra Falls because he had went there when he was my age when he went with his family. I am very grateful for him picking this destination because <br> it ended up being my favorite vacation. I hope that my Dad and I can return and make more memories sometime soon.</p>
			<h3>My Favorite Moments</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The best moment of the trip was easily the boat ride that goes super close to fall. A super fun and exciting moment for my Dad and I. <a href="https://www.maidofthemist.com/schedule-pricing/">The boat we were on</a>.</li>

					<li> Eating the best slice of pizza I've ever had. I sadly don't remember the name of the place but what I do remeber is the pizza being out of this world. My Dad and I still crave this pizza to this day.</li>
					<li> Visiting the <em><a href="https://www.ripleys.com/niagarafalls/">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a></em> museum. This was a fun moment because of all the weird stuff that was in the building  and the unpredictability of all it.</li>
